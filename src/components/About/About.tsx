        Hey there ðŸ‘‹  My name is Neelam and I am a frontend developer. Currently, as a Junior Front End Developer at Euro
        Communications, I focus on maintaining and enhancing website
        functionality, collaborating closely with team members.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        My expertise lies web design, mastering tools like HTML & CSS, with a
        proficiency in advanced styling frameworks such as TailwindCSS and SASS
        to create sleek and responsive user interfaces in the most effective and clean manner. I have also honed my
        skills in JavaScript and TypeScript, enabling me to bring interactivity
        and dynamic functionality to web applications. My proficiency extends to
        popular front-end libraries and frameworks, including React and Vue,
        where I specialize in building modular and scalable components. More recently, I have ventured into backend lannguages and databases, PHP, Laravel, and mySQL.
      </p>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        With a keen eye for design and a commitment to staying at the forefront
        of industry trends, I excel in translating creative concepts into
        polished, user-friendly interfaces. My journey as a self-taught
        developer reflects a dedication to continuous learning and adapting to
        emerging technologies.
